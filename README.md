<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>This repository includes five projects created in C Language, as a requirement for the CS50x Certificate.
The CS50x Certificate is endorsed by the Hardvard University and EDX. This course is an Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.</p>

<h2>Components</h2>

<hr />

### pset5 - Project Set number 5
<p>Data Strutures</p>

This project includes two programs:

- <em>Inheritance</em> Simulates the inheritance of blood types for each member of a family.

- <em>Speller</em> Implements a program that spell-checks a file, using a hash table.

<hr />

### pset4 - Project Set number 4
<p>Memory Management</p>

This project includes two programs:

- <em>Filter</em> Implements a program that applies filters to BMPs. This program creates efects in an image like: grayscale, reflection, blur, and edges.

- <em>Recover</em> Implement a program that recovers JPEGs from a forensic image. 
<hr />

### pset3 - Project Set number 3
<p>Algorithms in C</p>

There are two programs that implememt a plurality election.

- <em>Plurality</em>  Perhaps the simplest way to hold an election. is via a method commonly known as the “plurality vote” (also known as “first-past-the-post” or “winner take all”). In the plurality vote, every voter gets to vote for one candidate. At the end of the election, whichever candidate has the greatest number of votes is declared the winner of the election.

- <em>Tideman</em> Implements a program that runs a Tideman election. It is a ranked-choice system, voters can vote for more than one candidate. Instead of just voting for their top choice, they can rank the candidates in order of preference.

Includes three C programs to recognize the brand of a credit card, based on the credit card number. A progam to print a pyramid based on an input, and the basic hello.</p>

### pset2 - Project Set number 2
<p>Arrays in C. There are two programs:</p> 

- <em>Readability</em>  It is  a program that calculates the approximate grade level needed to comprehend some text. It implements the the Coleman-Liau index Test. The formula is:  index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8, where L is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text, and S is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text.

- <em>Substitution</em> This is a program that implements a substitution cipher. In a substitution cipher, we “encrypt” (i.e., conceal in a reversible way) a message by replacing every letter with another letter. To do so, we use a key: in this case, a mapping of each of the letters of the alphabet to the letter it should correspond to when we encrypt it. To “decrypt” the message, the receiver of the message would need to know the key, so that they can reverse the process: translating the encrypt text (generally called ciphertext) back into the original message (generally called plaintext).

### pset1 - Project Set number 1
<p>Includes three C programs</p> 

- To recognize the brand of a credit card, based on the credit card number. 
- A progam to print a pyramid based on an input, 
- The basic hello.
